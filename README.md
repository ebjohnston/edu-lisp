## Assignments
### 01 Factorial
This program returns the factorial of a given non-negative integer or `NIL` if the input is negative or not an integer.
### 02 Move to Front
This program checks to see if a word is in a list. If so, the word is moved to the front of the list. If not, the word is appended to the front of the list.
### 03 Divisible by Five
This program checks a list of numbers and returns the amount of numbers divisible by five.
### 04 Remove Negatives
This program takes as input a list of integers and returns a new list with all the negative entries removed.
### 05 Search Count
This program searches through a list for a given integer and returns the number of matches found in all lists, including embedded lists
### 06 Is Sorted
This program returns whether a list of number is sorted in strictly ascending order with no duplicate entries.
### 07 Temperature Conversion
This program takes a temperature in the form of a number and a unit (either Celsius or Fahrenheit) and returns the temperature value converted to the other unit.
### 08 Twin
This program returns a list that duplicates each input element into a pair of adjacent elements in the output list.
### 09 Untwin
This program returns a list that removes an element if it is identical to the element directly previous in a list with the comparison done in pairs of two (maximum of one deletion per pair).
### 10 Flatten
This program takes a list potentially containing nested lists and returns all embedded elements as members of a new top-tier list with `NIL` (the empty list) not being returned as an element of the new list.
### 11 Set Operations
This program contains three functions that each emulate a traditional set operation: member, which returns whether a word is an element of a given list; union, which returns the union of two lists as a new list; and intersect, which returns the intersection of two lists as a new list.
### 12 Syntax Check
This program checks whether a list is a valid expression of the form: number - operator - number with number representing an integer and operator being one of the following: plus, minus, times, or dividedby. Each expression can contain nested expressions on either side.
